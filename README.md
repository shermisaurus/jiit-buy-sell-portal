# jiit-buy-sell-portal
JIIT-62's SDF-2 2019 Even Sem Freshmen Year Mini Project. A mini buy, sell and rental service application will be created using C language; The user will have the option to upload their contents to sell, and also browse through varieties to buy or rent accessories which will be sorted using different categories.

## Project Contributors

**Batch** B-12

- Amrit Srivastava : 18104070
- Ishita Batra : 18104082
- Ankesh Bharti : 18104071
- Shubh Anand : 18104069

## Features

Different categories include price range, rent time, or type of accessory (furniture, electronics, or books). 

The modules will be as follows:

1. Uploading contents to resale or rent.

2. Browsing through various categories given as:
- furiture resale/rent 
- electronic gadgets resale/rent 
- vehicles resale/rent 
- books resale/rent 

3. The above subcategories will be further divided into sub-sub categories.

4. If resale is chosen, the resale cost uploaded by the seller will be shown. if rent is chosen, cost will be calculated on the time basis.



## Data Structures used and the reason behind

- A data structure is a specialised format for organising and storing data. General DS types include arrays, file, structure, trees, lists etc.
- The first and only data structure used is STRUCTURE to take details of the applicant and store details in the file.
- Strucutres and files are used in this project to improve efficiency and ease of variable access.
- We have not used any other data structure since that would be wastage of memory and would only serve to make the program complex.

## Functions Explained : Working and Algorithms

## Task Distribution 

-Amrit Srivastava : 18104070 :- coded the upload part, and checked project efficiency by refractoring ( process of systematically improving your code without writing new functionality ) existing functions and variables in the codebase.

-Ishita Batra : 18104082 :- coded rent and resale part of the project.

-Ankesh Bharti : 18104071 :- division of functions and categories in the codebase and prepared the report docs.

- Shubh Anand : 18104069 :- bringed up the project idea, workign and branching of the code.
